<h3> Years on the job </h3>

<p class="ex1">
I worked with kids with severe disabilities for over 18 years. 
I worked at a private day school, where kids that were not able to attend public shcool would go.  
They rode a bus to school everyday, it was not a residental facility. They could attend from the age of 3 
to the day before their 21 birthday. This was not the place I planned on working, I did one of my clinicals 
there and never left. I worked with the same students durning my time here along with new ones as they 
started to attend. On average we lost 3 students a year. At some point I got tired of going to funerals
 for childern.  </p>

<h3>Opportunity Knocks </h3>
<p class="ex1"> 
 A few years back I had an opportuntiy for a job change. The job I worked for 18 years was very specific, 
 even in the world of physical therapy so I never quite new if I would be able to transition into another
 facility. I thought this would be my time for change and I left for a new opportunity. 
 Well to do some health issues (not mine) things did not work out they way they were planned. 
 For this other role I went and got my health and life insurance license.  Then as more changes were going on
 I was appointed to sell medicare plans. During which time I decided to take HR Block tax course. 
 I wanted to better understand the impact taxes had on ones retirement. What would be the best for the clients
 worked with.  I never intended to work there. But low and behold I will be starting my third tax season at HR Block. </p>

<p class="ex1"> So for the last 3 years basicly I have been taking test durning any 
 free time I have. I have to renew my PTA license every two years with all 
 the required continue education. The same year I had to complete the continued for insurance license 
 in IL and MO along with multiple test to be recertified with each carry for medicare. And each year for taxes I need to
 complete 18 hour along with any course and test I want to complete to level up and increase my knowledge.</p>

<h3> News Show </h3>
<p class="ex1">
 So I was watching the morning news last year and seen this people on there talking about Launchcode. I was amazed.
 I remember thinking, really this program will teach you code and there is not tuition or fees of any kind. Well 
 of course between test and everythink I completely forgot. I kept thinking about the program but had forgot the name.
 Then a few month ago, I am watching the morning new and guess what came on, Launchcode.  Of course, I almost forgot 
 but I didn't!  It was late on the last night you could apply and then here I am. It has been a chalange, nerve racking,
 and drives me crazy but I feel so pleased with myself when I complete an assignment. I have meet some really nice
 people, ones that I consider friends.
